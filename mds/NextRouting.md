## Routing

- Tree
- Subtree
- Root
- Leaf
- URL Segment: Part of the URL path delimited by slashes. /users
- URL Path: Part of the URL that comes after the domain (composed of segments). /users/userId

### There are four ways to navigate between routes in Next.js:

- Using the Link Component
- Using the useRouter hook (Client Components)
- Using the redirect function (Server Components)
- Using the native History API
